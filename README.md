MOTIVATION

As a cricket fan, i wanted to analyse the ODI matches but i was unable to find any sites which contain all at single place. so i thought of making my own simple webapp on cricket analysis. I started learning Data science and thought it would be a great idea to build a simple project so that it boosts my portfolio.
